    "[miniFraudFinder](https://github.com/jrdetorre-google/minifraudfinder) is a series of labs on how to build a  fraud detection system on Google Cloud. Throughout the miniFraudFinder labs, you will learn how to read historical bank transaction data stored in data warehouse,  perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), do feature engineering,  train a model u, register your model in a model registry, evaluate your model, deploy your model to an endpoint, do real-time inference on your model and monitor your model."
